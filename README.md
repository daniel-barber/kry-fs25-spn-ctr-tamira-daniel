# SPN-CTR Encryption Project

In our kryptography module we received the task to implement a Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) cipher in CTR mode in Java. 

The Main class includes:
- Testing the SPN encryption and decryption
- Testing the SPN encryption and decryption in CTR mode
- Decrypting the chiffre that Bob recieved resulting in the plain text "Gut gemacht!"
